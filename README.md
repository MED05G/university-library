# University Library Management System

This project is a University Library Management System, likely built with Next.js, as indicated by the `next.config.ts` and `next-env.d.ts` files, and uses Drizzle ORM for database interactions.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the core application logic and pages.
- `auth.ts`: Handles authentication-related functionalities.
- `components/`: Houses reusable UI components.
- `database/`: Contains database schema definitions and connection logic.
- `drizzle.config.ts`: Configuration file for Drizzle ORM.
- `dummybooks.json`: Sample data for books, useful for development and testing.
- `eslint.config.mjs`: ESLint configuration for code linting.
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for various functionalities.
- `lib/`: Utility functions and helper libraries.
- `middleware.ts`: Next.js middleware for request processing.
- `migrations/`: Database migration files to manage schema changes.
- `next-env.d.ts`: TypeScript declaration file for Next.js environment variables.
- `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration file.

## Technologies Used (Inferred)

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Language**: TypeScript (based on .ts and .d.ts files)
- **Linting**: ESLint

## Setup and Installation (Assumed Steps)

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable, not part of this archive).
2.  **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project root and run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3.  **Database Setup**: Configure your database connection in the appropriate files within the `database/` directory. Run database migrations using Drizzle ORM commands (e.g., `drizzle-kit push` or `drizzle-kit migrate`).
4.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example` (if available) and populate it with necessary environment variables (e.g., database credentials, authentication secrets).
5.  **Run the development server**: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
6.  **Access the application**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your Next.js configuration).

## Usage

### Administrator Usage

Upon launching the application, administrators can log in using their credentials on the dedicated login page. After successful authentication, the administrator dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the library system. From here, administrators can:

*   **Monitor System Metrics**: View total users, total books, borrowed books, and overdue books at a glance.
*   **Perform Quick Actions**: Easily manage users, books, and borrow requests through quick action buttons.
*   **Review Recent Activity**: Track recent events such as new book borrowings, user registrations, and book returns.
*   **Check System Status**: Get real-time updates on pending requests, overdue books, occupancy rate, and active users.
*   **Navigate Sections**: Use the sidebar to access detailed views for all users, all books, borrow requests, and account requests.

### General User Usage (Inferred)

While specific user-side UI was not provided, it can be inferred that general users would be able to:

*   **Browse and Search Books**: Look for books available in the library.
*   **Borrow Books**: Initiate requests to borrow books.
*   **Manage Borrowed Books**: View their borrowed books and return them.
*   **Manage Account**: Update their profile information and view their borrowing history.
